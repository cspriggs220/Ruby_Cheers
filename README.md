My first exercise in Ruby programming, for my class at the Nashville Software School.  We were asked to print out a cheer that would iterate over each letter in the given name, and print it out as it would in a cheer.

I started out bare-bones and used the .each_char method, but have expanded to using Regex to catch vowels and print the correct article (a or an) with each letter.
